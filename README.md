# Virtual-HeNDI-Spectrometer

This web application is intended to provide users with an overview of the anatomy of a Helium NanoDroplet Isolation (HeNDI) spectrometer. The application allows users to experiment with changing parameters such as the nozzle temperature to better understand the effect of these parameters on the spectra collected by the instrument. The user can simulate collecting spectra at a variety of nozzle temperatures ranging between 13.5 and 20 K.

The web application is accessible at: https://rastonlab.github.io/Virtual-HeNDI-Spectrometer/

The virtual spectrometer is made up of one program.

- [Virtual-HeNDI-Spectrometer](https://github.com/RastonLab/Virtual-HeNDI-Spectrometer)

  - This repository contains the front-end and back-end of the program using the React JavaScript library.

## GitHub Pages

The front-end of this project is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This allows us to have automatic updates to the live website after commits and pull requests are made to the central repository. These updates are automatically handled using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Specifically, [GitHub Pages Deploy Action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) by James Ives. A simplified tutorial of this can be found on the [Raston Lab Wiki](https://github.com/RastonLab/.github/wiki/Tutorials#how-to-setup-a-github-action-to-host-a-react-application-on-github-pages)!
